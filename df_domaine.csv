0,Domaine des Croix 2016  Corton Grèves,2016,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Corton Grèves,94,"Firm and solid with great swathes of black fruits as well as dense tannins. Ripe fruits are a major element of this concentrated wine. The wine has power and a firm tannic core, and certainly needs aging for seven years."
1,Domaine des Croix 2017 La Vigne au Saint  (Corton),2017,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Corton,94,"A rich wine with great fruits as well as structure. It has the weight and great concentration of a grand cru selection. Plum fruits and acidity offer the potential for long aging. It's powerful, while also showing elegance. Age for 6–8 years."
2,Domaine des Croix 2016  Beaune,2016,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,90,"A perfumed village wine, this is made from four different parcels. The wine offers an attractive touch of tannin and spice to go with the forward red fruits. It should develop relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink from 2022."
3,Domaine des Croix 2019  Beaune,2019,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,90,"A structured wine, packed with red fruits and delightful acidity. There is a core of dark tannin and a solid structure as well as the bright freshness at the end. Because it has this structure, it's worth aging for 4–5 years."
4,Domaine des Croix 2017 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),2017,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,94,"This wine is perfumed with cherries and red berries. Its structure, which is certainly there, is almost secondary to this brilliant fruit. Balanced with a mineral dryness, the wine is certainly going to age into a ripe, pure-fruited wine. Drink from 2024."
5,Domaine des Croix 2015  Beaune,2015,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,90,"A structured wine, packed with red fruits and delightful acidity. There is a core of dark tannin and a solid structure as well as the bright freshness at the end. Because it has this structure, it's worth aging for 4–5 years."
6,Domaine des Croix 2018 Les Cent-Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),2018,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,93,"While this wine is firm, with some fine tannins, it also has a pure line in fresh strawberry fruits that will develop as the tannins soften. This perfumed wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2024."
7,Domaine des Croix 2016 Grèves  (Corton),2016,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Corton,95,"This wine has a smoky character that gives an exotic touch to the red fruits. It comes from 60-year old vines that give concentration and dark tannins. As it ages, the wine will broaden and expand to convey opulence and richness. Drink from 2022."
8,Domaine des Croix 2018 La Vigne au Saint  (Corton),2018,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Corton,95,"Dark fruit backs up the dense, dark and firm character of this wine. There is sweetness from the ripe fruits into which the tannins fall, leaving a trace of dryness at the end. A fine wine with a great future; drink from 2022."
9,Domaine des Croix 2019 Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),2019,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,94,"A fine, mineral, structured wine with a very dry, solid core. Juicy red fruits offer a hint for its future ripeness. It has the freshness of the vintage that shows through at the end of this chunky wine. Age for 5–7 years."
10,Domaine des Croix 2018 Les Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),2018,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,93,"From one of the top Beaune premier-cru vineyards, this wine is dark and dense with hints of wood as well as chocolate. To balance this, the ripe berry fruit is right there, deliciously fresh and with a tight line of acidity. A wine with a future, it is not ready to drink before 2024."
11,Domaine des Croix 2014 Pertuisots Premier Cru  (Beaune),2014,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Beaune,92,"Made from fruit sourced from a small premier cru that's located next to the famous Clos des Mouches, this is juicy, round and ripe, with a great swathe of soft, fleshy tannins."
12,Domaine des Croix 2014  Corton-Charlemagne,2014,Chardonnay,France,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,95,"A dry, mineral wine, hiding its potential richness. Flavors of ripe pears and yellow fruits are matched by lime acidity. The wine has considerable power and a dense character, showing the immense density that comes from this vineyard. Age for 4–6 years and more."
13,Domaine des Croix 2018 Les Peuillets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),2018,Pinot Noir,France,Burgundy,Savigny-lès-Beaune,92,"This wine has firm tannins and a dry, structured core. From vines that are close to Beaune, it is dense and concentrated, although with the pure fruit that marks out the vintage. It is going to develop well and with great style."
